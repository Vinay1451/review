# Adaptive CardioCare - A Haakathon Project

This project is an AI-powered, multi-patient cardiac health monitoring system developed as part of a personal "Haakathon" challenge. The goal is to build a professional, full-stack application from the ground up, leveraging modern web and AI technologies.

---

## The Haakathon Challenge: From Basic to Advanced

The challenge is broken down into three levels, representing the evolution of the application from a simple UI prototype to a fully integrated, intelligent system.

### Level 1: The Basic Answer (The Foundation - MVP)

This is the starting point, focusing on creating the user interface and ensuring all visual components are in place.

- **What to Build:**
  - A complete, visually appealing UI with a professional theme (dark/light modes).
  - All necessary pages and navigation: Dashboard, Patients List, Alerts, Reports, and Settings.
  - Component-based structure using ShadCN UI for elements like cards, tables, and charts.
  - Display of **static or simulated data** to make the application feel alive.
  - A responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile.

- **Status:** **Complete.** The application has a solid UI foundation.

### Level 2: The Intermediate Answer (Connecting to a Live Backend)

This level transforms the visual prototype into a dynamic, data-driven application. The focus is on replacing simulated data with a live database.

- **What to Build:**
  - **Connect to Firebase:** Integrate Firestore and Firebase Authentication into the application.
  - **Real-time Data:** Modify all pages to fetch data directly and in real-time from Firestore.
  - **Data Mutations:** Implement functionality to add, edit, and delete patients, with changes saved directly to the database.
  - **Authentication:** Secure the application so that only signed-in users can view and manage data.

- **Status:** **In Progress.** The app is connected to Firebase, but data fetching and mutations are not yet fully migrated from the simulation.

### Level 3: The Advanced Answer (Full-Stack AI Integration)

This is the most advanced level, where we leverage the full power of generative AI to make the application truly "intelligent."

- **What to Build:**
  - **Intelligent AI Agent ("Ballie"):** Enhance the AI assistant with tools to perform complex tasks, like querying the database for a patient's history before providing a summary.
  - **Proactive Alerting:** Create an AI flow that runs periodically, analyzes all patient data, identifies at-risk individuals, and automatically creates "Alert" documents in Firestore.
  - **The Digital Twin Foundation:** The current implementation serves as a proof-of-concept, visualizing how the heart will pump based on live BPM data (tested with normal and high values). This sets the stage for a future where this technology can be integrated with real IoT wearable devices for a true digital twin.
  - **End-to-End Features:** Build a complete, AI-driven workflow, such as the "Email Family Report" feature where the AI generates content that is then sent via an email service.
  - **Advanced Data Visualization:** Create more complex charts that combine historical data with AI predictions (e.g., "Projected risk score over the next 24 hours").

- **Status:** **Started.** Foundational AI flows are in place. The next step is to enhance them with tools and deeper integration.
